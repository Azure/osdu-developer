# OSDU Personal Instances

OSDU Developer is an open-source solution to enable easy creation of Personal Instances of OSDU running in the Azure Public Cloud.

## What is it?
 
This Azure Developer CLI (AZD) integrated solution, along with a one-click deployment option, allows engineers to explore authoring applications or work directly on individual or custom OSDU services prior to transitioning to a fully managed service offering like ADME.
 
The primary objective is to offer an environment for use as an inner loop development cycle within an organizationâ€™s own cloud tenant while working and exploring with the open-source codebase. This engineering environment is easy to work with and strives to ensure compliance through a flexible infrastructure framework, providing a path to explore the depth of OSDU.

Deploying a personal instance of the OSDU open-source solution on Azure Cloud delivers practical insights into early development and integration processes. It ensures transparency, cost-efficiency, and flexibility, while enabling essential application and cloud developer scenarios.
 
### Key Benefits

- **Observability and Transparency:**  Direct interaction with the resources, software, and components of the solution facilitates enhanced observability through logs, dashboards, and source code debugging, providing transparency crucial for developers.

- **Cost Efficiency:**  By deploying with minimal resources, cluster compute, and omitting costly features like disaster recovery (DR) and backup, consumption costs are minimized.

- **Flexibility:**  Supports scenarios such as:

- **Virtual Network Injection:** Allows for flexible network designs with site-to-site VPN connections and integration with preexisting networks.

- **Controlled Access:** Supports both public and private ingress along with the ability to layer your own routing solutions for ingress, such as Azure Firewall and Azure Front Door.

- **Software Isolation**:** Override and isolate the defined software customizations while extending into additional custom software configurations.

### Scenarios
 
Several scenarios illustrate the practical applications of this approach, such as:

- **Service Development:** Enables engineers to create, update, debug, and work with integrated OSDU services.
Application Development: Allows for easy developer integration with applications being developed for initial testing prior to integration with a managed service offering.

- **Innovate with Azure-Specific Technologies:**  Fork and extend the solution to explore deeper integration with Azure-specific tools and technologies such as Azure Fabric, Co-Pilot, and Power Platform, impacting various Azure integration points.

- **Training and Onboarding:**  Provides a valuable opportunity for training new employees on Azure within the OSDU framework, offering hands-on experience in a controlled environment.
