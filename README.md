OSDU Developer enables the deployment of personal instances of the [OSDUâ„¢](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform) data platform. 

For detailed instructions, view our online [Documentation](https://azure.github.io/osdu-developer/) and see what the team is currently working by looking through the [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/Azure/projects/696/views/2).

## OSDU Services

Supported services of OSDU are based on the release branch of OSDU as specified in the [OSDU Milestones](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform/-/milestones). (ie: release/0.25 release/0.26, release/0.27, master etc.)

#### To Run Locally

- __Visual Studio Code__: Install and configure with [REST Client Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) on your local machine. [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

- __PowerShell Core__: Installed on your local machine.  [Download](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.4)

- __Azure CLI__: Installed on your local machine. [Download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

- __Azure Developer CLI__: Installed on your local machine. [Download](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)

### CLI Deployment  (Recommended)

Deploying the resources via CLI is the recommended approach. This method allows for customization of the deployment parameters to better suit your needs, and offers tighter integration with other capabilities in this repository.

Follow this [tutorial](https://azure.github.io/osdu-developer/tutorial_cli/) for a quick overview of doing this from the Azure Cloud Shell.

> **NOTE:** Clone the latest version of this repo on your computer and switch to the directory. Note that the deployment scripts are being updated continously, make sure you update to the latest version.

> **NOTE:** If you are using a pre-existing Entra ID App, you will need to set the feature flag `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` with the values from your app (See [Feature Flags](https://azure.github.io/osdu-developer/feature_flags/#custom-infrastructure) for more information on feature flags).

```bash
# Authentication
az login --scope https://graph.microsoft.com//.default
az account set --subscription <your_subscription_id>
azd auth login

# Prepare Environment
azd init -e dev # This if first environment
azd env new dev # This if adding a new environment
azd env set <feature_flag> <value> # Set any necessary feature flags

# Provisioning
azd provision

# Configure Settings for Integrations
azd env set AUTH_CODE <auth_code>
azd hooks run settings

# Cleanup
azd down --force --purge
```


### Portal Template Deployment  (Alternative)

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fosdu-developer%2Fmain%2Fazuredeploy.json)

Deploying the solution is efficient and straightforward using an ARM (Azure Resource Manager) template. While this method utilizes default settings for ease of use, navigating parameter options and modifications can be challenging.

Follow this [tutorial](https://azure.github.io/osdu-developer/tutorial_arm/) for a quick overview of an ARM template deployment.

**Important Parameter Requirement:**

During the deployment process, some information is required to be provided in the deployment form:

- `Email Address`: A valid email address to be used as a first user.
- `Application Client Id`: Specify the Application Client Id. (The unique application ID of this application.)
- `Application Client Secret`: Specify the Application Client Secret. (A valid secret for the application client ID.)
- `Application Client Principal OID`: Specify the Enterprise Application Object Id. (The unique ID of the service principal object associated with the application.)
