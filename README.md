OSDU Developer enables the deployment of personal instances of the [OSDUâ„¢](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform) data platform. 

> For a fully managed implementation use [Azure Data Manager for Energy](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-manager-for-energy).

## Getting Started

> **IMPORTANT:** In order to deploy and run this example, you'll need an **Azure subscription** with [these namespaces](https://azure.github.io/osdu-developer/before_you_start/) registered. 

> **AZURE RESOURCE COSTS:** This solution will create an Azure Kubernetes Cluster that has a monthly cost and consumes a minimum of 44 vCPUs, as well as creation of other Azure Resources such as Storage Accounts, Cosmos Databases and Redis Cache.

Follow this [tutorial](https://azure.github.io/osdu-developer/tutorial_cli/) for a quick overview from the Azure Cloud Shell.

### Prerequisites

#### To Run in GitHub Codespaces or VS Code Remote Containers

This solution can be run virtually by using GitHub Codespaces or VS Code Remote Containers _(Docker required)_.  Click on one of the buttons below to open this repo in one of those options. 

[![Open in Remote - Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Remote%20-%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/Azure/osdu-developer)
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=GitHub+Codespaces&message=Open&color=brightgreen&logo=github)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?skip_quickstart=true&machine=basicLinux32gb&repo=742135816&ref=main&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json&geo=UsEast)

#### To Run Locally

- __Visual Studio Code__: Install and configure with [REST Client Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) on your local machine. [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

- __PowerShell Core__: Installed on your local machine.  [Download](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.4)

- __Azure CLI__: Installed on your local machine. [Download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

- __Azure Developer CLI__: Installed on your local machine. [Download](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)



### ARM Template Deployment  (Alternative)

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fosdu-developer%2Fmain%2Fazuredeploy.json)

Deploying the resources is efficient and straightforward using an ARM (Azure Resource Manager) template. While this method utilizes default settings for ease of use, navigating parameter options can be challenging.

**Important Parameter Requirement:**

During the deployment process, some information is required to be provided in the deployment form:

- `Email Address`: Specify a valid email address to be used as the first user.
- `Application Client Id`: Specify the Application Client Id. (This is the unique application ID of this application.)
- `Application Client Secret`: Specify the Application Client Secret. (A valid secret for the application client ID.)
- `Application Client Principal OID`: Specify the Enterprise Application Object Id. (This is the unique ID of the service principal object associated with the application.)

Upon completing the deployment, the infrastructure and software components will be automatically provisioned.
