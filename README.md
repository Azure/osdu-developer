# OSDU Developer Sandbox

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)  

The [Azure Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/) developer sandbox solution enables software development for the [OSDUâ„¢](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform) data platform. For a fully managed implementation use [Azure Data Manager for Energy](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/data-manager-for-energy).

Open the solution directly in a Github Codespace or clone it to a local machine.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/azure/osdu-developer)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Azure/osdu-developer.git
```

## Prerequisites

An active __Azure Subscription__ is required with the Azure App Configuration data plane permissions of `App Configuration Data Owner` assigned to the user at the subscription as explained [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-deployment-overview?tabs=portal#azure-app-configuration-authorization).


Local Machine usage requires the following.

- __Shell Requirements__: 
  - For Windows: PowerShell Core (pwsh) is required. You can download it [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).
  - For Linux or Mac: A bash POSIX-compliant shell is required.

- __Azure CLI__: Install and configure on your local machine. You can download it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

- __Azure Developer CLI__: Install and configure on your local machine. You can download it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).

    ```bash
    # Enable Alpha Feature Resource Group Scoped Deployments
    azd config set alpha.resourceGroupDeployments on
    ```

- __Visual Studio Code__: Install and configure on your local machine with the [REST Client Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client). You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).



## Setup


1. Authenticate

    ```bash
    # Login and set subscription
    az login --scope https://graph.microsoft.com//.default
    az account set --subscription <your_subscription_id>
    azd auth login
    ```

2. Provision

    ```bash    
    # Create Environment and provision the solution
    azd init -e dev # Environment name as desired.
    azd provision
    ```

3. Configure

    Once the environment has been provisioned, access the ingress URL `https://<your_ingress>/auth/` and obtain an authorization code for use in getting a refresh token for calling APIs.

    ```bash    
    # Set retrieved authorization code
    azd env set AUTH_CODE <your_auth_code>
    azd hooks run predeploy
    ```

4. Cleanup

    ```bash
    # Remove all resources
    azd down --purge --force
    ```


#### Optional Overrides

Environment settings can be overriden as necessary.

```bash
# Override Default Subscription
azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID <your_subscription_id>

# Override the Default Location
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION <azure_region>

# Override Client Id Creation
azd env set AZURE_CLIENT_ID <your_client_id>

# Override Software Location
azd env set SOFTWARE_REPOSITORY <your_git_url>
azd env set SOFTWARE_BRANCH <your_branch>
```

### ARM Template Deployment  (Alternative)

Deploying the resources is also efficient and straightforward using an ARM (Azure Resource Manager) template. While this method utilizes default settings for ease of use, navigating parameter options can be challenging if attempting customizations.

To facilitate a smooth deployment experience, we provide a "Deploy to Azure" button. Clicking this button will redirect you to the Azure portal, where the ARM template is pre-loaded for your convenience.

The application expects an [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-implicit-grant-flow) capable Entra Application has been preconfigured with either a Web or SPA platform configuration with the required redirect URIs for the ingress.

**Important Parameter Requirement:**

During the deployment process, identity information is necessary and required to be provided in the deployment form:

- `Email Address`: Specify a valid email address to be used as the first user.

- `Application Client Id`: Specify the Application Client Id. (This is the unique application ID of this application.)
- `Application Client Secret`: Specify the Application Client Secret. (A valid secret for the application client ID.)
- `Application Client Principal OID`: Specify the Enterprise Application Object Id. (This is the unique ID of the service principal object associated with the application.)


Upon completing the deployment, the infrastructure and software components will be automatically provisioned. This includes loading the software configuration through a [GitOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/example-scenario/gitops-aks/gitops-blueprint-aks) approach, enabled by AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service).

To begin, simply click the button below:
