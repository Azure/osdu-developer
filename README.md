# OSDU Developer

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

[Open Subsurface Data Universe](https://osduforum.org) (OSDU) is a standard data platform that brings together a diverse array of subsurface and well data. It enables the energy industry to access and analyze data across various sources efficiently. This project aims to provide a streamlined approach to showcase a mechanism to develop and work directly with [OSDU](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform) while using the [Microsoft Azure Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/).


## Guiding Principles

The guiding principle of this development approach is to offer a way to facilitate direct engagement with the OSDU codebase on the Azure Cloud in a minimal fashion. This is not recomended for any production use and is purely seen as a method for development and does not come with any type of official support. The approach aligns with three key pillars from the [Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/what-is-well-architected-framework):

1. __Cost Optimization__ -- We aim to create a cost-effective approach, balancing cost along with security considerations.
2. __Security__ -- Our goal is to enhance security levels within the constraints of working to allow for development in a secure manner, working to ensure a zero trust approach to development.
3. __Operational Excellence__ -- A strong DevOps, Standards, and Automation approach is always thought of first.

To support ease of use, this idea integrates closely with [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) and the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/), working to facilitate seamless development and innovation on ideas.

### Desired State

To accomplish the goal of a `minimal` approach the use of a desired state approach is a key driver.

__Bicep for Desired State Configuration__

Bicep is a domain-specific language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources declaratively. It is built on top of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and simplifies the syntax and experience of authoring ARM templates. With Bicep, you define the desired state of your Azure infrastructure in code. This includes specifying the resources you want to deploy, their configurations, and the relationships between resources.

When you deploy a Bicep file, Azure Resource Manager (ARM) processes the file and ensures that the Azure environment matches the defined desired state. If the actual state drifts from the desired state defined in the Bicep file, redeploying the Bicep template can correct this drift, realigning the actual state with the desired state.

__GitOps for Desired State Management__

GitOps extends the desired state management concept to application deployment. It uses Git as a single source of truth for declarative components and applications. With GitOps, you store the entire state of your software components and applications in Git repositories, and any changes to the state are made through Git commits.

Automated processes or operators continuously monitor the Git repository for changes. When a change is detected, these operators ensure that the actual state of the components or application (running in environments such as Kubernetes) is updated to match the desired state defined in the Git repository.

__Combination of Bicep and Gitops__

The combination of Bicep and GitOps is a powerful strategy that allows for a single place where both the infrastructure and software are fully defined, enabling the system itself to work towards achieving the state that has been described. This integrated approach ensures alignment between infrastructure provisioning and application deployment, streamlining and automating the entire provisioning and application deployment process.


## Setup

This section guides you through setting up the necessary Azure features for this development workspace. Please note that this uses Azure features currently in Public Preview, which might not be fully stable and are subject to changes.

### Registering Azure Features

Before you begin, you need to register specific features in Azure that this approach relies on. Here's how to do it:


**Step 1: Register the AzureServiceMeshPreview feature**

The AzureServiceMeshPreview feature enables [AKS service mesh addon for Istio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/istio-about). To register this feature, use the Azure CLI command below:

```bash
az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureServiceMeshPreview"
```

_* Please wait a few minutes for the feature to register. The process might take up to 10 minutes._


**Step 2: Verify the Registration Status**

After registering the feature, ensure that the registration was successful. Check the status using the following command:

```bash
az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "AzureServiceMeshPreview"
```

Look for a status that indicates "Registered". If the status hasn't updated, you may need to wait a little longer and try again.


**Step 3: Refresh the Resource Provider**

Once the feature is registered, it's necessary to refresh the resource provider to apply the changes. Use this command to refresh the Microsoft.ContainerService resource provider:

```bash
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
```

With these steps, you have successfully registered the necessary Azure features. Next, you can proceed to the deployment phase.


# ARM Template - Deployment

Deploying the resources is efficient and straightforward using an ARM (Azure Resource Manager) template. While this method utilizes default settings for ease of use, it's worth noting that navigating parameter options can be challenging. For users seeking customization, we recommend using the Azure Developer CLI - Deployment, detailed in the following section.

To facilitate a smooth deployment experience, we provide a "Deploy to Azure" button. Clicking this button will redirect you to the Azure portal, where the ARM template is pre-loaded for your convenience.

__Important Parameter Requirement:__

During the deployment process, there's one essential parameter you need to provide:

`applicationClientId`: Fill this with the Application ClientId that you intend to use. This step is crucial for the proper functioning of the template.
Upon completing the deployment, the infrastructure and software components will be automatically provisioned. This includes loading the software configuration through a [GitOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/example-scenario/gitops-aks/gitops-blueprint-aks) approach, enabled by AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service).

To begin, simply click the button below:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fosdu-developer%2Fmain%2Fazuredeploy.json)



# Azure Developer CLI - Deployment

The recommended approach for working with this is through the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview). This method provides greater flexibility for customization and setting options. Hereâ€™s a streamlined guide to using the Azure Developer CLI:


## Enabling Alpha Features for Azure Developer CLI

This solution utilizes Alpha Features in the Azure Developer CLI for advanced functionalities.

**Resource Group Scoped Deployments**

This allows more granular control over deployments at the resource group level.

Enable this feature using the following command:

```bash
azd config set alpha.resourceGroupDeployments on
```

Note: Alpha features are in experimental stages and may undergo changes.


## Authentication

Authenticate your session to interact with Azure resources:

```bash
azd auth login
```

## Setting Up Environment Variables

Define the necessary environment variables for your deployment:

1. Initialize the environment and set the Azure Client ID:

```bash
azd init -e dev
```

2. Set Azure Client ID:

Replace <your_ad_application_name> with your actual Azure AD Application Name.

```bash
APP_NAME=<your_ad_application_name>
azd env set AZURE_CLIENT_ID $(az ad app list --display-name $APP_NAME --query "[].appId" -otsv)
azd env set AZURE_CLIENT_PRINCIPAL_OID $(az ad sp list --display-name $APP_NAME --query "[].id" -otsv)
azd env set AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET $(az ad sp credential reset --id myServicePrincipalID --query "password" -otsv)
```

3. Set Software Repository Location:

Configure the location of where the software declaration is.

```bash
azd env set SOFTWARE_REPOSITORY https://github.com/azure/osdu-developer
azd env set SOFTWARE_BRANCH main
```



## Optional Features

Customize your resources by enabling these optional features based on your specific requirements:


### Feature: Pod Subnet

__Purpose:__ Enhances network configuration for Kubernetes Pods.

__Details:__ Typically, with kubenet in Kubernetes, nodes are assigned IP addresses from the Azure virtual network subnet. Enabling the Pod Subnet feature allows Pods to receive IP addresses from a different address space, separate from the subnet of the nodes. This separation alters the network flows.


__How To Enable:__

```bash
azd env set ENABLE_POD_SUBNET true
```


### Feature: Vnet Injection

__Purpose:__ Enables a bring your own network capability.

__Details:__ Typically, internal solutions require a preconfigured network due to possible S2S vpn configurations or a Hub Spoke Network design.

__How To Enable:__

```bash
azd env set ENABLE_VNET_INJECTION true
azd env set VIRTUAL_NETWORK_GROUP <your_network_group>
azd env set VIRTUAL_NETWORK_NAME <your_network_name>
azd env set VIRTUAL_NETWORK_PREFIX <your_network_prefix>
azd env set VIRTUAL_NETWORK_IDENTITY <your_network_managed_identity>

azd env set AKS_SUBNET_NAME <your_subnet_name>
azd env set AKS_SUBNET_PREFIX <your_subnet_prefix>

azd env set POD_SUBNET_NAME <your_subnet_name>
azd env set POD_SUBNET_PREFIX <your_subnet_prefix>
```


### Feature: Manage

__Purpose:__ Facilitates secure access to internal network resources.

__Details:__ Internal ingress configurations can sometimes make it challenging to access network resources. The Bastion feature addresses this by creating a bastion host and a virtual machine. These components act as a secure gateway, allowing you to communicate with and manage resources within the private network, even if they're not exposed to the public internet.

__How To Enable:__

```bash
azd env set ENABLE_MANAGE true
```

### Feature: Public Blob Access

__Purpose:__ Control public access to Blob Storage.

__Details:__ The Storage accounts have public access points that can be enabled or disabled to enhance security.

__How to Disable:__

```bash
azd env set ENABLE_BLOB_PUBLIC_ACCESS false
```


## Deployment Commands

Efficiently manage the resources with these Azure Developer CLI commands. They are designed to streamline the deployment process, allowing for a smooth setup and teardown of your environment.

__Starting the Deployment__

To initiate the deployment, use the following command:

```bash
azd provision
```

This command starts the provisioning process, setting up all necessary resources in Azure according to your configuration.

__Removal and Cleaning up__

When you need to remove your deployment and clean up resources, use this command:

```bash
azd down --purge --force
```

This command will stop all running services and remove resources that were created during the deployment. The --purge flag ensures that any keyvaults are completely removed, and the --force option bypasses any confirmation prompts, making the process faster.

## Software Management with a Gitops Approach

In this workspace, we utilize a GitOps approach for efficient and reliable software management. This method leverages this Git repository as the source of truth for defining and updating the software configurations and deployments within the infrastructure.

### GitOps Configuration

Our GitOps configuration resides in this Git repository and uses a customized [repo-per-team](https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/repository-structure/#repo-per-team) pattern. This repository includes:

- __Configuration Files__: YAML files defining the desired state of our components and applications.

- __Charts__: Helm charts used for defining, installing, and upgrading Kubernetes applications.

### Advantages of GitOps

- __Consistency and Standardization__: Ensures consistent configurations across different environments.
- __Audit Trails__: Every change is recorded in Git, providing a clear audit trail.
- __Rollbacks and Recovery__: Every change is recorded in Git, providing a clear audit trail.
- __Enhanced Security__: Changes are reviewed through pull requests, increasing security and collaboration.

Our GitOps approach simplifies the process of deploying and managing software, making it easier to maintain and update, as well as providing a configurable way of leveraging other software configurations by pointing to alternate repositories hosting other configurations. By leveraging this method, we ensure that our deployments can be extended to things that not only include the default software load. 

## Customizations

There are many things that can be done to customize the deployment.  One example of this might be virtual network injection.

See [this tutorial](docs/vnet-injection.md) for how a customization like this might be performed.
