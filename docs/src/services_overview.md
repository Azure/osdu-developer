## Experimental Software

OSDU offers various experimental capabilities that are either very new or community contributions. These services are not yet fully mature but are available for early adopters to test and provide feedback. This solution supports the concept of experimental software through opt-in feature flags, allowing users to selectively enable and test these new features.

!!! note
    Experimental software is often less stable and contains less documentation.
